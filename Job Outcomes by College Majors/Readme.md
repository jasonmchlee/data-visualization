# College Majors

## Overview
In this project, I worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

## Dataset
Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more. Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

- Rank - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
- Major_code - Major code.
- Major - Major description.
- Major_category - Category of major.
- Total - Total number of people with major.
- Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
- Men - Male graduates.
- Women - Female graduates.
- ShareWomen - Women as share of total.
- Employed - Number employed.
- Median - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.
- Low_wage_jobs - Number in low-wage service jobs.
- Full_time - Number employed 35 hours or more.
- Part_time - Number employed less than 35 hours.
